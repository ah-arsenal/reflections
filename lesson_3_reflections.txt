When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Use a remote repository when working with others! 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pull changes manually so you can stage your changes locally, or test a feature on an old version.
